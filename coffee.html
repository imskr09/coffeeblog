			<h1>Talk Over Coffee</h1>
			<p id="pass">
				Is your daily dose of coffee just not enough for you? Are you looking for something a little extra? Perhaps some coffee education? Or the latest gossip in the coffee industry? Then a coffee blog just might be for you.

                If you’re a coffee lover, coffee geek, coffee nerd, or just someone looking for more information about coffee, here are my favorite online coffee resources. Brew a fresh batch and start reading.

			<li><h2>Sprudge</h2><p>Sprudge is a site devoted to coffee news and culture, and you’ll get everything from updates on new coffee shop openings to coverage of coffee culture in far-off places, like Iran. They also run a site called Sprudge Wire, where they round up coffee news from around the web all in one place — a great resource if you want to know what’s happening in the world of coffee, and who is writing about it. (In full disclosure, I am a Sprudge contributor, so I am of course 100 percent biased in making this a daily morning visit to read what’s new.</p><img src="coffee1.jpg"></li>

			<li><h2> Daily Coffee News</h2><p>Daily Coffee News is a website run by Roast Magazine. It’s more geared toward coffee professionals than the average coffee drinker, but it’s full of news related to the coffee world — with a big focus on sustainability.	</p><img src="coffee2.jpg"></li>

			<li><h2>Jimseven</h2> <p>Jimseven is the blog of James Hoffman, a well-respected figure in the specialty coffee industry. He’s not only a former barista champion, but also the co-founder of Square Mile Coffee Roasters in London, as well as the author of The World Atlas of Coffee. Hoffman has been penning the blog for over 10 years; it’s a much-visited resource within the coffee community.</p><img src="coffee3.png"></li>
			<li> <h2>Barista Hustle</h2>
            <p>Are you a barista? Thinking about becoming one? Just want to get inside the head of the barista who is serving your coffee? Then Barista Hustle is for you. It’s actually a weekly email, but you can also access some of the articles on the website as well.</p><img src="coffee4.jpg"></li>
